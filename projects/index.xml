      <description>Les Garderies K.I.D.S. is a chain of daycares in the Montreal region. I completed a number of projects for this group. Below you can find a select list of projects, some associated photos, and testimonials.
Video Viewing Screens  One of the video viewing screens.Daycare staff needed access to live video streams of different areas of the daycares so that they can keep watch of everything going on. For this I installed a number of PoE cameras alongside custom video viewing screens which were placed around the daycares.</description>

      <description>Some time ago, I started a small mentoring program, to help interested learners improve their computer skills. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken on a small number of participants to keep quality high, and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve had some great results. Here are some of their testimonials.

      <description>After having spent well over five years using and writing Puppet, I decided that I had some designs for a next generation automation tool. This eventually became what is now known as Mgmt Config or mgmt.
 Mgmt runs as a distributed system.The project has a number of novel features, including an event-based execution engine, a reactive domain specific language (DSL) and the ability to execute in parallel. A cluster of mgmt agents can self-coordinate and run as a distributed system using the raft consensus algorithm.</description>
