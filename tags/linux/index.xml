      <title>Magic typing with shortcuts on Linux</title>

      <description>Ever find yourself typing more characters than is necessary when using some annoying application or website? Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick hack around that.
Intro:
There&amp;rsquo;s a magic program called xdotool written by Jordan Sissel that solves this problem. I&amp;rsquo;ve known about his excellent work for years, but only today did I learn he also wrote xdotool. It&amp;rsquo;s named as such because it tells the X server to do something for you.</description>

      <title>USB Audio on a Boombox</title>

      <description>In an earlier post, I got USB audio working on my used, manual, 2013 Honda Civic EX. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same for a Sony ZS-RS60BT boombox.
 Here it is in all its used glory after a little cleaning.Background:
I decided I should get a small portable boombox to practice my dope dance moves. I currently still suck because I think I spend more time computering than out on the floor.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I&amp;rsquo;m available for hire. Experienced at Linux/Golang/Mentoring/etc. More information below!

  A drawing of me coding away.  A photo of me giving a talk to a sold-out crowd. Background:
Two years ago, I left my job at Red Hat to work on mgmt config full-time. I&amp;rsquo;m still passionate about this project, and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of the progress that has been made in the last two years, but it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to explore new opportunities as well.</description>

      <title>Inexpensive Dynamic DNS over IRC</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2020/09/01/inexpensive-dns-over-irc/</link>

      <description>The one thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for longer than ssh is dynamic dns. In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I built an inexpensive, reliable, private alternative to the mainstream tools commonly available today using only golang and IRC.
Background:
I&amp;rsquo;ve had an account with dyndns.org for a long time. They used to be free, but then they cut off the free tier, but left existing accounts alone, until they eventually cut all the non-payers off entirely.</description>

      <title>USB Car Audio in a Civic</title>

      <description>Transportation is very important to me. My whole life I&amp;rsquo;ve never owned a car. I have gotten by with biking, public transit, and various car sharing services. Sadly, biking is incredibly dangerous and stressful, because most cars don&amp;rsquo;t respect bicycles, and in the winter it&amp;rsquo;s not very practical, the STM (public transit) offers an incredibly unreliable and unpleasant service, and Car2Go (car sharing) now requires that you use their proprietary smart phone app (you used to be able to just swipe the membership card) so I finally gave up and decided to buy a used car.</description>

      <title>One hour hacks: Remote LUKS over SSH</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/04/25/one-hour-hacks-remote-luks-over-ssh/</link>

      <description>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</description>

      <title>Next generation configuration mgmt</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.
I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

      <title>New puppet-gluster features before Linuxcon</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/09/08/new-puppet-gluster-features-before-linuxcon/</link>

      <description>Hey there,
I&amp;rsquo;ve done a bit of puppet-gluster hacking lately to try to squeeze some extra features and testing in before Linuxcon. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short list:  SELinux fixes to keep Dan Walsh happy :) Ping and status checks before volume creation. Now puppet-gluster will be less noisy about failures or missing executions that are due to the necessary incremental nature of puppet-gluster runs. You&amp;rsquo;ll need multiple puppet runs to get a complete setup, so don&amp;rsquo;t let puppet complain part way through.</description>

      <title>puppet lsi hardware raid module</title>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/06/17/puppet-lsi-hardware-raid-module/</guid>
      <description>In response to some discussion in the gluster community, I am releasing my puppet-lsi module. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple, but it is very useful for rebuilding machines. It could do a lot more, but I wanted to depend on the proprietary LSI tools as little as possible. Running megacli with puppet would be a very doable hack, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure enough devops out there who would use that feature.
Usage is straightforward if you like the sensible defaults:</description>

      <title>Overriding attributes of collected exported resources</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/05/14/overriding-attributes-of-collected-exported-resources/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2013/05/14/overriding-attributes-of-collected-exported-resources/</guid>
      <description>This post is about a particularly elegant (and crucial) feature in puppet exported resources: attribute overriding. If you&amp;rsquo;re not already familiar with exported resources, you should start there, as they are the killer feature that makes configuration management with puppet awesome. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any explicit docs about this feature either, so feel free to comment if you know where they&amp;rsquo;re hidden.)
Setup: I&amp;rsquo;ve got a virtual machine which exports a resource to N different nodes.</description>

      <title>getting gedit to work like magic</title>

      <description>i use gnu/linux. it&amp;rsquo;s probably no secret. what is more of a secret, is that i secretly (well actually not so secretly) love using gedit for editing text. i still use vim, echo (gnu bash) and emacs (but only for org-mode).
vim is really, really great. but for day to day full-screen coding, i love working in gedit. i only have one [1] longstanding gripe, and today i believe that it is solved.</description>

      <description>not that what i&amp;rsquo;m about to tell you is brilliant, new or revolutionary, however i thought i&amp;rsquo;d mention it in case you&amp;rsquo;re not doing it. also feel free to let me know if there is a better way.
problem: i have some stdout which comes from a command and i want it in a file on another machine.
i could first send it to a temp file, scp that over, and then remove the temp file; but instead, i&amp;rsquo;ll just:</description>

      <description>while doing a little reading and research, i ended up reading a bit of the hdparm man page. never in my life have i read such a scary man page. i guess it is appropriate for halloween, but it came 2 days late in my case. as a result of my being so impressed with the sheer amount of warnings in the manual, i have decided to compile them here.  &amp;ndash;dco-restore Reset all drive settings, features, and accessible capacities back to factory defaults and full capabilities.</description>

      <description>after a brief bout of stupidity i quickly realized that my makefile had gone awry and was quickly eating through my filesystem.
after ^C killing it, it seems i only took out most of /lib/* and /usr/sbin/* &amp;ndash; who needs those anyways&amp;hellip; apparently almost everyone.
what happened next. well it turns out i was lucky and had a few shells and a webbrowser open&amp;ndash; attempts to launch new programs will fail, but existing programs are already loaded in memory so i was able to work.</description>
